# Project Arduino: Pandemic Queue Distancing Alert

Description: This project uses HC-SR04 to measure the distance value between the object and the sensor itself. The clock will count to check if there are any changes in the distance value. The distance value that has been measured will be displayed on the LCD. A warning message will be displayed on the LCD if the value exceeds the given distance. Simultaneously, the distance detected by the sensor will be displayed, but only when a certain range has been violated will the warning message appear, not the distance value anymore.

# Feature Lists
A device that signals people to avoid physical contact at a distance of approximately 6 meters.

When the distance is not followed, warning signals will flash on the screen as a reminder.

The line queue is monitored by an unmanned system.

Due to its demand on the situation, it is applicable and attachable everywhere.
